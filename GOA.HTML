              <p class="card-text">Beaches play a starring role among the attractions in Goa, contributing to why it's one of the best places to visit in India.

                Nearly every tourist who visits the area spends a day at Palolem Beach, a crescent-shaped stretch of white sand that overlooks the Arabian Sea in south Goa. While simply hanging out and soaking up the scenery is a perfect way to enjoy this beautiful area, Palolem Beach also offers an array of activities to fill your time.</p>

              <p class="card-text">While known for their spectacular scenery, the popular beaches in Goa tend to get crowded during high season, leaving some travelers eager for a quieter natural escape. Fortunately, Goa brims with undiscovered beach attractions and things to do that give you some distance from the throngs of tourists while still treating you to glorious sand and surf.

                One of the best hidden gems in Goa is Butterfly Beach. It has a curving expanse of sand flanked by boulders that create a postcard-worthy cove, brimming with butterflies and blossoms. It's also a great spot to watch dolphins swim in the distance.</p>

              <p class="card-text">South India has been known for its abundance of spices, like black pepper, cardamom, and cloves, for centuries. In fact, these natural flavorings were a major appeal for Portuguese traders who came to Goa hundreds of years ago.

              Tourists can see what the local spice scene is all about by touring Tanshikar's Working Spice Farm & Ecological Rest House. .</p>

              <p class="card-text">While many tourists visit Goa for the beaches, countless others consider the trip to be a pilgrimage to important religious sites, like the Basilica de Bom Jesus.

                This Old Goa attraction dates back to the late 16th century and contains the remains of the St. Francis Xavier. The "Apostle of the Indies" co-founded the Society of Jesus religious order with friend St. Ignatius Loyola and spearheaded an extensive mission in India. The basilica has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1999..</p>

              <p class="card-text">Aquatic adventures go beyond the beach in Goa. The state is also home to Dudhsagar Falls, a spectacular four-tiered waterfall that towers some 310 meters above the earth. It's one of India's tallest waterfalls and a perpetually popular attraction for day trips around Goa and Karnataka.

                To reach the falls, you'll need to make your way to the village of Colem by taxi or train. Depending on which train route you take, you may get a glimpse of Dudhsagar Falls along the way. </p>

              <p class="card-text">Goa is home to a ton of markets, but none offer the liveliness or selection of products found at Anjuna Market. For roughly 50 years, hundreds of vendors have been setting up shop on Anjuna Beach every Wednesday to tempt free-spirited travelers with hippy-inspired trinkets and souvenirs.

                Ornate textiles, woven bikinis, sculptures of deities, dreamcatchers, hammocks, magnets, t-shirts with sassy slogans, beaded jewelry, toys â€“ you name it, you can probably buy it here.</p>
