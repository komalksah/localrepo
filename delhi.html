        <p>The street food in Delhi is legendary. Tangy delights such as chaat papdi (fried wafers loaded with potatoes, chickpeas, yogurt and chilli) or golgappas (fried hollow dough filled with chickpeas and spicy potatoes), are de rigueur in Old Delhi. Also seek out stuffed parathas (fried breads with vegetable fillings), sizzling kebabs and treacle-dripping jalebis (sweet swirls of fried dough).</p>
             
        <a class="navbar-brand fw-bold fs-1 text-dark " href="#">2. Admire the grandeur of Humayun's Tomb</a>
        <p>Humayun's Tomb combines Persian elegance with fine Indian craftsmanship, and its graceful lines are mirrored by the fiercely symmetrical Mughal Gardens that surround it. For the best photos, stroll here at dusk, or simply admire the architecture at any time of day.</p>
        
      
        <a class="navbar-brand fw-bold fs-1 text-dark " href="#">3. Gurudwara Bangla Sahib</a>

Never fear; the complex has one you can borrow for the duration of your visit. While touring the building, don’t miss visiting the busy kitchen that feeds many of Delhi’s residents. If you’re keen, you can even lend a hand-shaping and baking chapatti.</p>
